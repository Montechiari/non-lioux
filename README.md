# Non-lieux


Non-lieux is a collective whose goals are to produce and promote webservices for generative art. The word is french for "non-places", and represents the proposition of making art that is hosted on servers.
Our primary task is to standarize interface schemas, so creative software can communicate and be integrated. This will allow colaborative creation of digital art. Non-lieux's members are expected to introduce their medium in the standards folder strucutre. Once their niche is specified,
they are free to propose a convention to be built-uppon by other artists working in projects of the same kind. This will be a forum on which they will discuss specs for the creative webservices they develop.
Socially, non-lioux's proposition is to encourage artists to arrange remote colabs.
